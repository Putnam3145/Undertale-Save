To get the file for a specific point in this playthrough, simply:

1. Go into the [commits menu](https://github.com/Putnam3145/Undertale-Save/commits/master)

2. Click on the button labeled <>, the rightmost button of that particular commit to get to the "browse repository" view

3. Click the "download ZIP" button near the bottom right of the browse repository view to download the file; then, move it to the %localappdata%/UNDERTALE folder (backup your save first!)

Be warned that this was a fairly... uh, minimalist pacifist playthrough. I barely got any healing items throughout, but AFAIK my inventory was full enough through most of it since I didn't heal against anyone who wasn't Mettaton EX or ASGORE.
